# Cell state velocities

This Github repository is complementary to our paper "Towards reliable quantification of cell state velocities", which is out as preprint on Biorxiv (XXX). In this repository you can find all the Python scripts and notebooks that you will need to reproduce the figures in the paper.

This repository is still under construction, so stay tuned for more features and insights into our method.

Any questions or comments? Feel free to write us under issues (https://github.com/bjbouman/cell-state-velocities/issues)
