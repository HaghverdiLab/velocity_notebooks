# Cell state velocities

This Github repository is complementary to our paper **"Towards reliable quantification of cell state velocities"**, which is out as [preprint on Biorxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.17.484754).

### Overview
This repository contains two sets of notebooks:
- figures_notebooks/  contains all the notebooks to reproduce the analysis and figures in the paper
- tutorials/  shows and explains how to run the $\kappa$-velo analysis pipeline based on the example of the pancreas endocrinogenesis dataset

### Requirements

The toolbox for eco-velo and $\kappa$-velo has been made available as a python package. This package, with additional information on installation can be found [here](https://github.com/ValerieMarot/velocity_package).
